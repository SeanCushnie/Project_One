# Project_One

BRIEF:
MVP:
1: The inventory should track individual products, including a name, description, stock quantity, buying cost, and selling price.
2: The inventory should track manufacturers, including a name and any other appropriate details.
3: The shop can sell anything you like, but you should be able to create and edit manufacturers and products separately
4: Show an inventory page, listing all the details for all the products in stock in a single view.
5: As well as showing stock quantity as a number, the app should visually highlight "low stock" and "out of stock" items to the user.
Extensions:
6: Calculate the markup on items in the store, and display it in the inventory
7: Filter the inventory list by manufacturer. For example, provide an option to view all books in stock by a certain author.
8: Categorise your items. Books might be categorised by genre (crime, horror, romance...) and cars might be categorised by type (SUV, coup√©, hatchback...). Provide an option to filter the inventory list by these categories.
9: Mark manufacturers as active/deactivated. Deactivated manufacturers will not appear when creating new products.
